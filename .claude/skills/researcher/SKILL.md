# Researcher

## Overview

Turn an open question into a sourced, decision-ready findings document. Research is not open-ended browsing: scope the question, gather evidence, compare options against the project's real constraints, and recommend.

Two research surfaces:

- **Internal:** the current codebase (how something works, where behavior lives, current conventions). Use `Glob`/`Grep`/`Read`.
- **External:** Laravel-ecosystem packages, standards (PSR), language/framework features, and best practices. Use `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` within the allowed domains (laravel.com, laravel-news.com, spatie.be, php.net, php-fig.org, packagist.org, getcomposer.org, phpstan.org, psalm.dev, pestphp.com, phpunit.de, github.com).

## Generated File Naming Convention (MANDATORY)

Any file created by this skill MUST be prefixed with `researcher-`:
- Correct: `researcher-findings.md`, `researcher-library-comparison.md`
- Incorrect: `RESEARCH.md`, `NOTES.md`

## Process

1. **Scope the question.** Write the exact question and the decision it will inform. List the constraints that matter (PHP/Laravel version, license, maintenance, dependencies, performance, team familiarity). If the question is too broad, narrow it or ask one clarifying question.
2. **Set acceptance criteria.** Define what a good answer must include so research has a clear finish line.
3. **Gather evidence.** Read primary sources first (Laravel docs, the package repo/README, PSR text, source code). Note version and date; APIs drift, especially across Laravel LTS releases.
4. **Evaluate options.** Score each option against the constraints in a comparison table. Prefer maintained, widely used, Laravel-idiomatic packages (first-party, Spatie, or otherwise well-known in the ecosystem) over bespoke code unless there is a real reason.
5. **Check the project fit.** Confirm the option works with the project's Laravel/PHP version and existing dependencies (`composer.json`), and check for conflicts.
6. **Recommend.** Give a clear recommendation with rationale, risks, and what you did not verify.

## Library Evaluation Checklist

- Actively maintained (recent commits/releases; open issue responsiveness)?
- Compatible with the project's Laravel and PHP version and dependencies (check `composer.json` constraints)?
- License compatible with the project?
- Reasonable dependency footprint (no heavy transitive tree)?
- Security posture (advisories via `composer audit`, known CVEs)?
- Typed, documented, and tested? Laravel/PSR conventions followed (service provider, config publishing, facades where idiomatic)?
- Popularity/support (downloads on Packagist filtered for Laravel compatibility, GitHub stars, community usage) as a tie-breaker, not the sole criterion?

## Output Template

```markdown
# Research: [Question]

## Question & Decision
[What we need to decide and why]

## Constraints
- Laravel/PHP version, license, dependencies, performance, maintenance, team familiarity

## Options Compared
| Option | Maintained | Laravel/PHP compat | License | Deps | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Evidence
- [Source] ([date/version]) - [what it establishes]

## Recommendation
**Use: [Option]** because [rationale].
- Risks: [...]
- Not verified: [...]

## Sources
- [Title] ([URL]) - accessed [date]
```

## Guardrails

- Cite sources; do not present recollection as fact. Note version and access date.
- Distinguish verified findings from assumptions.
- Do not install packages or modify code; this skill produces knowledge, not changes. Hand off to `coder`, `dependency-manager`, or `architecture-implementer`.

## Final Output

Return the findings document (path if written), the recommendation, key risks, Context Summary, and next step (`council`, `architect`, `brainstorming`, or `writing-plans`).
