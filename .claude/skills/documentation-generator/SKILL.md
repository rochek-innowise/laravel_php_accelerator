# Documentation Generator

## Overview

Document Laravel implementation details in a way that helps future maintainers run, test, extend, and safely operate the system.

## Documentation Targets

- `README.md` for setup, local development, test commands, deployment notes, and troubleshooting.
- `specsdocumentation-generator-implementation.md` for living implementation details.
- ADRs for durable architecture decisions.
- API docs for public or cross-team endpoints.
- Changelog entries for release-visible changes.

## README Checklist

Include:

- Required PHP version (8.2+) and extensions (e.g. `ext-pdo`, `ext-mbstring`).
- Laravel version (11 or 12) and Composer install/usage.
- Local setup and how to run the app (`php artisan serve`, or Sail/Docker if configured).
- Database setup and migration commands (`php artisan migrate`, `php artisan migrate --seed`).
- Queue worker, scheduler, cache, and mail setup if used (`php artisan queue:work`, `php artisan schedule:work`).
- Test, format, and static-analysis commands (`php artisan test`, `vendor/bin/pint`, `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse`).
- Frontend asset build commands if a pipeline exists (`npm install && npm run dev` / `npm run build` via Vite).
- Environment variables by name only, never secret values.

Example local setup commands:

```bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill values locally (never commit real secrets)
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
php artisan test
```

## Living Specification Updates

Read `specs/MANIFEST.md` first. Update or create `specsdocumentation-generator-implementation.md` when build process, deployment, tooling, worker/cron behavior, or development workflow changes.

Use task-prefixed sections:

```markdown
### [TASK-001] Invitation Registration Tooling (2026-06-29)

**Runtime:** Laravel 12, PHP 8.3+, MySQL

**Verification:**
- `php artisan test`
- `vendor/bin/pint --test`
- `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse`

**Operational Notes:**
- Invitation emails are dispatched via a queued Notification.
- The scheduler (`php artisan schedule:work` or a cron entry running `php artisan schedule:run` every minute) drives the invitation-expiry job in production.
```

## API Documentation

For API changes, include:

- Route table (`routes/api.php`).
- Auth requirements (Sanctum tokens/guards).
- Form Request validation rules.
- API Resource response shapes.
- Error codes.
- Rate limits (`throttle` middleware).
- OpenAPI generation command if configured.

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-0001: Use A Dedicated Policy Class For Invitation Authorization

## Status
Accepted

## Context
[Why this decision exists]

## Decision
[What was decided]

## Consequences
[Trade-offs and follow-up requirements]
```

## Documentation Best Practices

- **Keep docs next to the code** and update them in the same change that alters behavior; stale docs are worse than none.
- **Write for the newcomer:** a reader should be able to clone, install, configure, and run from the README alone.
- **Show runnable examples;** prefer copy-pasteable commands and real code over prose. Verify the commands actually work.
- **Explain the "why", not just the "what":** reserve rationale and trade-offs for ADRs so history is not lost.
- **Follow Keep a Changelog + SemVer** for `CHANGELOG.md`: group by Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed, newest first, human-readable.
- **Document by name, never by value:** list required environment variables and secrets by name only.
- **One source of truth:** link to the canonical spec instead of duplicating long-lived information across docs.

## Final Output

Return:

- Documents updated.
- Key operational details.
- Verification performed.
- Context Summary.
- Next by flow: `release`, `finishing-branch`, or `verify`.
