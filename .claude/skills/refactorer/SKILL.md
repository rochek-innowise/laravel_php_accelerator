# Refactorer

## Overview

Improve code structure without changing what it does. The safety contract of refactoring is: observable behavior stays identical, proven by tests before and after.

Targets Laravel (PHP 8.2+, 8.3+ required for Laravel 13). Supports Laravel 12 (current LTS) and Laravel 13 (current release).

## Scope Boundary

If a change alters observable behavior — new feature, bug fix, different output — that is `coder`, not this skill. The moment you need to change what the code *does*, stop refactoring, ship the behavior change via `coder`, then refactor separately. Keep the two in separate commits so review and rollback stay clean.

## The Safety Rule

```
NO REFACTOR WITHOUT A CHARACTERIZATION SAFETY NET
```

Before changing structure, ensure tests cover the behavior you are about to move. If coverage is missing, add characterization tests first (or hand off to `test-generator`), then refactor.

## Workflow

1. **Pin behavior.** Run the existing tests; if the area is untested, write characterization tests that capture current behavior (including quirks). Record a green baseline.
2. **Refactor in small steps.** One transformation at a time; keep the suite green after each step. Commit-sized increments, not a big-bang rewrite.
3. **Modernize types.** Add `declare(strict_types=1)`, parameter/return/property types, and readonly where safe.
4. **Automate where possible.** Use Rector (with `driftingly/rector-laravel` for framework-aware rules) for mechanical, rule-based changes (dead code, type declarations, PHP/Laravel version migrations); review each diff.
5. **Re-verify.** Run tests, static analysis, and formatting. Behavior and public signatures must be unchanged unless the task explicitly allows API changes.

## Common Refactorings

- Extract Method / Extract Class to break up long functions and God classes.
- Replace conditional sprawl with polymorphism or a lookup map.
- Introduce a value object to replace primitive obsession.
- Introduce an interface at a boundary to enable testing and swapping.
- Replace static/global calls with injected dependencies.
- Replace magic arrays with typed DTOs.
- Guard clauses to flatten nested conditionals.

## Laravel-Specific Refactor Targets

- **Fat controllers → Actions/Services.** When a controller method does more than parse input, authorize, delegate, and respond, extract the workflow into an Action or Service class (see `architect` for when to use which) — this is a pure extraction if behavior is preserved.
- **Raw queries → Eloquent.** Replace hand-written SQL/`DB::select()` calls with Eloquent query builder or model relationships where it doesn't sacrifice necessary performance; verify the generated SQL is equivalent (check with `DB::listen()` or `->toSql()`) before and after.
- **Manual array shaping → API Resources.** Replace ad hoc `return response()->json([...])` shaping with a proper `JsonResource` when the same shape is duplicated across controllers.
- **Duplicated validation → Form Requests.** Consolidate repeated inline `$request->validate([...])` rule arrays into a shared Form Request.
- **Laravel major-version upgrades.** Treat an upgrade (e.g. Laravel 10 → 11 → 12) as a refactor: follow the official `laravel/upgrade` guide as a *process* (read the upgrade guide for the target version, update `composer.json` constraints, run `composer update`, apply `rector-laravel` rules for mechanical changes, fix deprecations, re-run the full suite) rather than following exact fixed steps, since guidance changes per release.

## Rector Usage

```bash
vendor/bin/rector process --dry-run   # preview changes
vendor/bin/rector process             # apply, then review the diff
```

Prefer curated rule sets (dead code, code quality, a specific PHP version upgrade set, plus `RectorLaravel\Set\LaravelSetList` sets from `driftingly/rector-laravel` for framework-specific mechanical upgrades). Never blindly accept a large Rector diff; review it like any change.

## Code Smell Catalog

Recognize the smell, then apply the matching refactoring:

| Smell | Signal | Refactoring |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Long method | Does many things; hard to name | Extract Method; guard clauses |
| Large/God class | Too many responsibilities | Extract Class; split by responsibility |
| Long parameter list | 4+ params, booleans | Introduce Parameter Object / DTO |
| Primitive obsession | Raw strings/ints for domain concepts | Introduce Value Object / enum |
| Feature envy | Method uses another object's data more than its own | Move Method |
| Shotgun surgery | One change edits many files | Consolidate behavior behind one seam |
| Duplicated logic | Copy-pasted blocks | Extract shared method/class |
| Conditional sprawl | Nested `if`/`switch` on type | Polymorphism or lookup map |
| Temporal coupling | Methods must be called in a hidden order | Encapsulate the sequence |
| Static/global calls | `new`/globals inside logic | Inject dependency behind interface |

## Large Refactors: Strangler Fig

For risky, large-scale change, do not rewrite in place. Build the new implementation beside the old, route a slice of behavior to it behind a seam (interface/feature flag), verify parity, migrate slice by slice, then remove the old path. Each step keeps the suite green and is independently revertible.

## Boundaries

- Do not change behavior; if you discover a bug, note it and hand off to `coder` or `systematic-debugger` rather than silently "fixing" it inside a refactor.
- Do not change public signatures/contracts unless the task explicitly scopes an API change.
- Keep refactor commits separate from behavior-change commits so review and rollback stay clean.

## Verification

```bash
php artisan test          # or vendor/bin/pest — must match the pre-refactor result
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse # Larastan-configured; equal or fewer errors than baseline
vendor/bin/pint --test
```

## Final Output

Return what was refactored, the safety net used, the before/after test result, any bugs found (not fixed here), Context Summary, and next step (`verify`, `code-reviewer`, or `test-generator`).
