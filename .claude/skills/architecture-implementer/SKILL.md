# Architecture Implementer

## Overview

Take an approved architecture (from `architect`, a spec in `specs/`, or a `council` decision) and lay down the structural skeleton in Laravel: models, controllers, policies, Form Requests, API Resources, migrations, and Service Provider bindings, generated via `artisan make:*` where possible. Leave feature logic thin and clearly marked as TODO for `coder`.

This skill builds the frame, not the whole house. It should produce a scaffolded, autoloadable, testable skeleton with seams in the right places, using Laravel's own generators to keep boilerplate idiomatic.

## Scope Boundary

This skill stops at the **skeleton**: models, empty/thin controller methods, Form Request shells, policy method stubs, Resource classes, migrations, and Service Provider bindings with TODO markers. The moment real feature logic goes inside a method (validation rules, policy conditions, Action bodies), that is `coder`. Upstream, the architectural *decision* itself belongs to `architect` (or `council`) — if no approved decision exists, do that first. In short: `architect` decides → `architecture-implementer` scaffolds → `coder` fills in behavior.

## Preconditions

Before scaffolding, confirm:

- An architecture decision exists (read `specs/architect-architecture.md` or the provided decision). If not, recommend `architect` first.
- The target models, relationships, authorization needs, and API surface are decided.
- The project's Laravel version (`composer.json` `laravel/framework` constraint or `php artisan --version`) and any conventions already in place (e.g. Actions vs Services directory).

## What To Scaffold

1. **Migrations.** `php artisan make:migration create_invoices_table` (or `add_x_to_y_table`) with columns, foreign keys, and indexes matching the decided schema.
2. **Eloquent models.** `php artisan make:model Invoice -mf` (with migration + factory) or just the model if the migration already exists; declare `$fillable`/`casts()` and relationship method signatures.
3. **Policies.** `php artisan make:policy InvoicePolicy --model=Invoice` with method stubs (`view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) returning a clear TODO/placeholder.
4. **Form Requests.** `php artisan make:request StoreInvoiceRequest` with an `authorize()` stub and an empty/TODO `rules()` array.
5. **API Resources.** `php artisan make:resource InvoiceResource` (and `InvoiceCollection` if a custom collection shape is needed) with a `toArray()` stub listing the fields to expose.
6. **Controllers.** `php artisan make:controller Api/InvoiceController --api` (or `--resource` for web) with method signatures wired to the Form Request/Resource, bodies marked TODO.
7. **Actions/Services (if the architecture calls for one).** Create the class with a `handle()`/`__invoke()` signature and constructor-injected collaborators, body left as `TODO`/`throw new \RuntimeException('Not implemented')`.
8. **Service Provider bindings.** Register interface-to-implementation bindings in `AppServiceProvider` (or a dedicated provider) for any swappable external dependency the architecture named.
9. **Routes.** Add the route(s) in `routes/api.php`/`routes/web.php` (e.g. `Route::apiResource(...)`) pointing at the new controller, without implementing behavior.
10. **Factories/seeders.** Scaffold a factory (`make:model -f` or `make:factory`) so tests can build fixtures immediately.

## Rules

- Follow Laravel's dependency direction: routes -> controllers -> Actions/Services -> Eloquent models; Service Providers bind interfaces for external integrations. Controllers should not contain business logic.
- Every new PHP file starts with `declare(strict_types=1);` and full type declarations.
- Prefer `artisan make:*` generators over hand-writing boilerplate — they produce the idiomatic base class/namespace/imports automatically.
- Do not implement business rules, validation rules, or policy conditions here; mark them clearly for `coder`.
- Keep the skeleton verifiable: migrations should run (`php artisan migrate`), models/routes should resolve, and `php artisan route:list` should show the new routes.
- Do not add layers the architecture did not call for (e.g. don't add a Service if only an Action was decided).

## Example Skeleton Shape

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;

final class Invoice extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    /** @var list<string> */
    protected $fillable = ['customer_id', 'total_cents', 'status'];

    /** @return BelongsTo<Customer, $this> */
    public function customer(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Customer::class);
    }
}
```

This property-based `$fillable` is the correct default because it scaffolds cleanly on either Laravel version this accelerator supports (12 or 13) — do not add a native `array` type to it, since `Model::$fillable` is declared untyped in Eloquent's base class and PHP's invariant property-typing rules make a typed override in a subclass a fatal error. On a project confirmed to be on Laravel 13 (PHP 8.3+), the `#[Fillable(['customer_id', 'total_cents', 'status'])]` class attribute is a valid alternative that sidesteps this entirely (see `eloquent`'s Mass Assignment Protection section) — but only reach for it when the project has already standardized on attribute-based model configuration, not as a blanket rewrite of every scaffolded model.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Policies;

use App\Models\Invoice;
use App\Models\User;

final class InvoicePolicy
{
    public function view(User $user, Invoice $invoice): bool
    {
        // TODO(coder): implement ownership/role check.
        throw new \RuntimeException('Not implemented');
    }
}
```

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Actions;

use App\Models\Invoice;

final class IssueInvoice
{
    public function handle(array $data): Invoice
    {
        // TODO(coder): implement issuance rules + DB::transaction().
        throw new \RuntimeException('Not implemented');
    }
}
```

```php
// app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php
public function register(): void
{
    // TODO(coder): confirm concrete implementation once billing decision is finalized.
    $this->app->bind(PaymentGateway::class, StripePaymentGateway::class);
}
```

## Verification

```bash
composer dump-autoload
php artisan route:list --path=invoices
php artisan migrate --pretend   # confirm migration is syntactically valid without applying
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse      # if configured; confirms wiring types line up
```

## Handoff Map

Produce a table so `coder` knows exactly what to fill in:

```markdown
| File | Responsibility | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| app/Actions/IssueInvoice.php | issuance workflow | TODO: implement |
| app/Policies/InvoicePolicy.php | authorization rules | TODO: implement checks |
| app/Http/Requests/StoreInvoiceRequest.php | validation rules | TODO: implement rules() |
```

## Final Output

Return the created structure, models/policies/resources/migrations added, Service Provider bindings, the handoff map of TODOs, verification run, Context Summary, and next step (`coder` to implement, then `test-generator`).
