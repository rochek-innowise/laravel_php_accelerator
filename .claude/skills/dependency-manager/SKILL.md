# Dependency Manager

## Overview

Keep the dependency tree healthy, secure, and reproducible. Dependencies are attack surface and maintenance cost, so every addition and update is a deliberate decision.

Targets Laravel (PHP 8.2+, 8.3+ required for Laravel 13). Supports Laravel 12 (current LTS) and Laravel 13 (current release).

## Core Commands

```bash
composer validate --strict     # composer.json/lock integrity
composer audit                 # known security advisories in the tree
composer outdated --direct     # direct deps with newer versions
composer show --tree           # inspect the dependency graph
composer why <package>         # why a package is installed
composer why-not <package> <version>  # what blocks an upgrade
php artisan about              # installed Laravel version, environment, and key package versions
```

## Health Check Workflow

1. **Integrity.** `composer validate --strict`; confirm `composer.lock` is committed and in sync.
2. **Security.** `composer audit`; triage each advisory (severity, whether the vulnerable path is used, fixed version available).
3. **Freshness.** `composer outdated --direct`; separate patch/minor (low risk) from major (needs review/changelog, especially a `laravel/framework` major bump).
4. **Laravel compatibility.** Check the `laravel/framework` constraint in `composer.json` and run `php artisan about` to see the resolved Laravel version plus first-party package versions (Sanctum, Horizon, Telescope, etc.) at a glance; confirm any package you touch declares support for the project's Laravel version.
5. **Footprint.** Look for redundant, abandoned, or overly heavy packages (`composer show --tree`).
6. **Autoload.** Ensure PSR-4 autoload is correct; for production builds recommend `composer dump-autoload -o` (or `--classmap-authoritative`).

## Updating Safely

- Prefer scoped updates: `composer update vendor/package --with-dependencies` over a blanket `composer update`.
- Read the changelog/UPGRADE notes for minor/major bumps.
- Run the full test suite and static analysis after any update; a green build is the acceptance gate.
- Commit `composer.json` and `composer.lock` together with a note on what changed and why.

## Version Constraints

- Use caret constraints (`^1.2`) for libraries following SemVer to allow safe minor/patch updates.
- Avoid `*` and unbounded `>=` constraints; they make builds non-reproducible.
- Pin only when necessary (a known incompatibility) and document the reason.
- Keep `require` (runtime) and `require-dev` (tooling: PHPUnit/Pest, PHPStan/Larastan, Laravel Pint, Rector) correctly separated.
- Check that third-party packages declare a `laravel/framework` compatibility range that includes the project's version before bumping; a package capped below the project's Laravel version will block `composer update`.

## Laravel Package Ecosystem

- **First-party (Laravel-maintained):** `laravel/sanctum` (first-party API/session token auth — default choice unless OAuth2 is explicitly required, in which case use `laravel/passport`), `laravel/horizon` (Redis queue dashboard/monitoring), `laravel/telescope` (local/staging debugging — never expose in production without gating), `laravel/scout` (search indexing), `laravel/cashier` (Stripe/Paddle billing — webhook handlers must be idempotent: verify the signature and de-duplicate on the event/webhook ID, since both providers retry delivery; a common security/correctness gap in billing integrations).
- **AI-agent tooling:** `laravel/boost` — an official first-party dev dependency that runs as an MCP server, giving AI coding agents structured, live access to a project's actual routes, Eloquent schema, config values, a Tinker REPL, recent log entries, and version-pinned Laravel documentation. Directly reduces hallucinated APIs for AI-agent workflows like this accelerator's. Suggested, not mandatory, for new Laravel projects using this accelerator (`composer require laravel/boost --dev`, then `php artisan boost:install`).
- **Popular third-party:** Spatie packages (`spatie/laravel-permission` for roles/permissions, `spatie/laravel-data` for DTOs, `spatie/laravel-medialibrary`, `spatie/laravel-query-builder`), `laravel/pint` (formatting, first-party but distributed as a dev dependency), `nunomaduro/larastan` (PHPStan rules for Laravel/Eloquent-aware static analysis), `driftingly/rector-laravel` (Rector rules for Laravel upgrades/refactors).
- Prefer first-party packages for core cross-cutting concerns (auth, queues, search) before reaching for a third-party alternative, unless the third-party package is clearly the ecosystem standard for the need (e.g. `spatie/laravel-permission` for complex role/permission matrices beyond simple Gates).

## Vetting A New Package

Before adding a dependency (coordinate with `researcher` for deeper comparisons):

- Actively maintained and compatible with the project's PHP and Laravel versions (check the package's `composer.json` constraints)?
- License compatible with the project?
- Reasonable transitive dependency footprint?
- No open advisories (`composer audit` after install)?
- Would a small amount of first-party code, or a feature Laravel already ships (queues, notifications, Sanctum), avoid a heavy dependency? Weigh it.

This skill covers *consuming* Composer packages. If the actual deliverable is a new, standalone reusable package (not an application feature), use `package-developer` instead.

## Guardrails

- Never write credentials into `composer.json` (`github-oauth`, `http-basic`); use auth outside the repo.
- Do not commit `vendor/`.
- Do not run a blanket `composer update` right before release; do scoped, tested updates.
- Do not add a dependency to solve a one-line problem.

## Final Output

Return audit/outdated results, actions taken (updates, constraint changes, autoload optimization), residual advisories/risks, verification run, Context Summary, and next step (`verify`, `security-reviewer`, or `researcher`).
