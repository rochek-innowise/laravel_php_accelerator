# Verify

## Overview

Run the active edition's `DOD.md` and produce a clear pass/fail report. Do not install missing tools. Report missing tooling as `N/A - tooling not configured`. Prefer the project's Composer/Artisan scripts when they exist.

## Step 1: Determine Tier

- Documentation/planning only: Minimum.
- Implementation task: Standard.
- PR, merge, or release readiness: Full.

## Step 2: Run Applicable Checks

### Minimum

```bash
git diff --stat
```

Also check:

- Skill-prefixed files in `tasks/` and `specs/`.
- Context Summary and Next Steps.
- No secrets or `.env` access.

### Standard

Run when files/tooling exist (prefer Composer/Artisan scripts, fall back to `vendor/bin/*`):

```bash
composer validate --strict
php -l <changed-files>
php artisan test          # or vendor/bin/pest / vendor/bin/phpunit
vendor/bin/pint --test    # Laravel Pint formatting check
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse  # Larastan config, or vendor/bin/psalm
```

Pick the commands that match the project. Do not run both Pest and PHPUnit as separate suites if the project standardizes on one (Pest can run PHPUnit-style test classes too). For larger suites, prefer `php artisan test --parallel` when the project already has `brianium/paratest` configured; do not force it onto a project that doesn't use it.

If server-rendered Blade/frontend files changed and tooling exists:

```bash
<blade-or-template-lint-command>
<css-lint-command>
<frontend-build-command>   # e.g. npm run build (Vite)
```

### Full

```bash
composer audit
gh run list --limit 1
```

Also verify:

- PR description has summary and test plan.
- Changelog/specs/docs updated when required.
- No unresolved TODO/FIXME/HACK in changed source files.
- New/changed migrations are reversible and reviewed for production data impact.
- Queue/Horizon, cache, and config-cache impacts are documented.

## Step 3: Promote Verified Brain Records

Verification is the only step that re-checks a claim against reality, so recording that outcome is part of the verification itself: a fact that passed but stays `observed` never qualifies for automatic promotion, and the pass would leave no trace in governed memory.

For every Project Brain record (finding, bug, incident, decision) whose claim this run actually confirmed, promote its authority BEFORE transitioning the record to a terminal status (`resolved`, `closed`, `accepted`):

```bash
python3 memory-bank/scripts/context.py brain-update \
  --record-id <id> --revision auto \
  --authority verified --reason "Verified: <check that confirmed it>"
```

Only the `observed -> verified` transition is accepted; the terminal transition follows in a separate `brain-update --transition <terminal-status>`. Skip records this run did not confirm — an unverified claim must stay `observed`.

## Report Template

```markdown
## Verification Report

**Tier:** Standard
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

| Check | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Working tree | PASS | `git diff --stat` reviewed |
| Composer | PASS | `composer validate --strict` |
| Tests | PASS | `php artisan test` |
| Formatting | PASS | `vendor/bin/pint --test` |
| Static analysis | PASS | `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse` (Larastan) |

**Result:** PASS

### Notes
- No unresolved risks.

### Context Summary
[2-3 sentences]

### Next Steps
- `finishing-branch` if ready.
```

## Failure Handling

If any required check fails:

- Mark result as FAIL.
- Include the exact command.
- Include the shortest useful failure summary.
- Recommend `coder` for clear fixes or `systematic-debugger` for unclear failures.

## Final Output

Return the verification report and stop.
