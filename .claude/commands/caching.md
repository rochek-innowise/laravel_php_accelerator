# Caching

Spawn caching agent to design and implement a Laravel caching strategy: Cache facade patterns, stampede prevention, driver-specific tagging, model-level caching, and invalidation-on-write correctness.

## Input
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Use the Task tool to spawn a sub-agent:
- **subagent_type:** `caching`
- **description:** `Implement Laravel caching strategy`
- **prompt:** `$ARGUMENTS`

The agent will use the caching skill and suggest next steps when done.
