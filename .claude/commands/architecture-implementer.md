# Architecture Implementer

Spawn architecture-implementer agent to scaffold and wire an approved architecture into Laravel (models, controllers, policies, Form Requests, API Resources, migrations, Service Provider bindings), ready for feature code.

## Input
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Use the Task tool to spawn a sub-agent:
- **subagent_type:** `architecture-implementer`
- **description:** `Scaffold architecture`
- **prompt:** `$ARGUMENTS`

The agent will use the architecture-implementer skill and suggest next steps when done.
