# Stabilization

Use this document to turn repeated agent mistakes, workflow friction, and user corrections into durable rules.

## Cycle

```text
Incident -> Root Cause -> Rule -> Example -> Enforcement -> Verification
```

## When To Stabilize

- The same mistake happens more than once.
- A user correction reveals a missing rule.
- A hook blocks too much or too little.
- A Laravel convention (Form Request validation, Policy authorization, Eloquent parameter binding) is violated repeatedly.
- A workflow handoff is confusing.

Use stabilization for enforceable behavior that prevents a repeated agent failure. Use `project-brain/` for governed active tasks, handoffs, findings, bugs, incidents, decisions, events, and promotion proposals. Use `memory-bank/` for verified governed reusable consequences and governed promotion application. Use `specs/` for authoritative architecture and behavioral contracts; canonical sources always outrank both context stores.

Session hooks may surface only mode, index health/staleness, active binding count, and validation status. They must never index, retrieve, print, or inject Project Brain or Memory Bank records automatically.

## Rule Template

```markdown
### Rule: [Short Name]

**Trigger:** [What happened]
**Root cause:** [Why it happened]
**Rule:** MUST/MUST NOT [enforceable behavior]
**Example:**
- Incorrect: [bad example]
- Correct: [good example]
**Enforcement:** Policy / skill instruction / hook / review checklist
**Added:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Retired:** YYYY-MM-DD or omit while the rule is live
**Superseded-by:** [Short Name of the replacement, or omit]
```

A rule with a `Retired:` date moves to `## Retired rules` at the end of this
file and its line is removed from wherever it was enforced. That matters
because `AGENTS.md` is paid on every session of this edition and is gated in
CI, while this file is not: a procedural pillar that can only ever add rules
runs out of budget and has nothing to give back.

## Laravel Examples

### Rule: Validate Via Form Requests

**Trigger:** A controller read `$request->input(...)` directly and acted on it without validation.
**Root cause:** Skill guidance did not require a Form Request at the boundary.
**Rule:** MUST validate input via a Form Request (or explicit validator) before using it in a controller.
**Example:**
- Incorrect: `$user = User::create($request->all());`
- Correct: `$user = User::create($request->validated());` with a `StoreUserRequest` defining the rules.
**Enforcement:** `AGENTS.md`, `coder` skill, code review checklist.

### Rule: Authorization Is Server-Side

**Trigger:** A UI button was hidden, but the endpoint was still callable.
**Root cause:** Authorization was treated as a frontend concern.
**Rule:** MUST enforce protected actions via a Policy or Gate checked in the controller/Action, not by hiding UI.
**Example:**
- Incorrect: hide the Delete button only.
- Correct: `$this->authorize('delete', $post);` (or `Gate::authorize(...)`) before acting.
**Enforcement:** `AGENTS.md`, `architect`, `coder`, `code-reviewer`.

### Rule: Avoid N+1 Queries

**Trigger:** A Blade view or API Resource looped over a relationship inside a collection, issuing one query per row.
**Root cause:** No eager loading was applied before the loop.
**Rule:** MUST eager-load relationships (`with()`/`load()`) that will be accessed across a collection.
**Example:**
- Incorrect: `Post::all()` then `$post->author->name` inside the view loop.
- Correct: `Post::with('author')->get()` before the loop.
**Enforcement:** `AGENTS.md`, `coder`, `performance-optimization`, `code-reviewer`.

## Retired rules

Rules that no longer apply, kept for the same reason a superseded memory chunk
is kept: the reasoning that produced them is evidence, and deleting it invites
the same mistake again. A rule here is not policy. It carries the `Retired:`
date that removed it and, when something took its place, `Superseded-by:`.

_None yet._

## Verification

After adding a rule:

1. Read the target file back.
2. Confirm the rule does not conflict with existing policy.
3. If possible, add or update a hook/checklist item.
4. Run `/verify` if enforcement behavior changed.
